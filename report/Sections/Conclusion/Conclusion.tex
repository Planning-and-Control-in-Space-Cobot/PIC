In this work, we have proposed a novel approach for cooperative payload transportation in microgravity environments using multiple free-flying robots. By leveraging advanced trajectory generation, optimization, and motion control techniques, our system aims to improve the efficiency and safety of payload movement within space stations. The proposed approach integrates a continuous planning system with a feedback loop, ensuring real-time adaptation to changes in the environment. Through the use of Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) and distributed approaches, we have addressed the challenges of uncertainty and dynamic changes in the payload properties. Our simulation results, supported by real-world testing, demonstrate the potential of the system to optimize payload transportation while ensuring robustness and scalability. This work lays the foundation for future advancements in space robotics, contributing to more efficient and autonomous operations in microgravity environments.
