To create a realistic simulator, a physics-based simulator, Gazebo, was used. This simulator can simulate the dynamics of the system in real time, as well as the sensors employed, and it is easy to integrate with both ROS and ROS2. This integration was a key requirement, as ROS is one of the most widely used sets of libraries for robot communication. We used an already available modification of the Gazebo garden available in \href{https://github.com/DISCOWER/PX4-Space-Systems}{PX4 space system github}, this already has an easy plugin to simulate the real autopilot used, meaning all we could reuse all the code already developed in this project.
