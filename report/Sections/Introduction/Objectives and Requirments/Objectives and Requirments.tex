The objectives we have for this work is to be an improvement over the current method of transporting payload in space, as currently the astronaut needs to move from one module to the other to transport the payload. This means we need to be able to generate the trajectory in a fast and controlled manner, and not be the main cause of delay's in a research hour. We also must be able to work cooperativly to decrease the time taken and increase the weight capacity of the payload as well as follow a path that is safe and efficient. Our work will not have the objective of being working in the outside of a space station, as this requires a to consider orbital dynamics, for prollonged periods of time, and also requires a robot that is able to work in a vacuum, and with a large range of temperatures. /tra
