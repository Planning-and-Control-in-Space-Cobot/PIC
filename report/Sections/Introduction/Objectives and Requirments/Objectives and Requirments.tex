The primary objective of this work is to enhance the current method of payload transportation within space modules. Presently, astronauts must manually move from one module to another to transport payloads, which is both time-consuming and inefficient. Our approach aims to enable fast and controlled trajectory generation, minimizing delays during valuable research hours. Additionally, the system must support cooperative operations to reduce transport time, increase payload capacity, and ensure the path followed is both safe and efficient. It is important to note that this work does not aim to address payload transportation outside a space station, as such scenarios require considerations of orbital dynamics over extended periods, as well as a robot capable of functioning in a vacuum and enduring extreme temperature variations.
