One of the possible problem the robots can help solve is payload cooperative transportation, as mention in the previous section. This problem is a rather complex one since it involves generating a feasible path for multiple robots and a payload to follow, and then executing this path in a way that is safe, meaning we must always be scanning out environment to stray away from any obstacles, moving or static, that may be in the way and are not mapped. 

This means we have two main stages during the execution, the first will be from a basic map of the environment, generate a path that is feasible for all robots, this is a complex task since the generation of such task can be highly complex task, taking to long to compute, and this defeates the main propuse of this types of robots, since it will decrease the overall efficiency of the task even before we start moving. The second problem at hand is the execution of the path, this is also a complex problem, since we must understand the dynamics of the system, and how each robot movement affect the dynamics of the full system, but we also must be able to scan our environement in real time an detect obstacle that we may come into contact with, and be able to either replan the path or in the worst case scenario stop the payload and robots from moving, to avoid any damages to the robots, payload or the environment. The problem of object detection in it self is also a complex one since we must not only detect the object, but also understand the shape and have an estimate of both the distance and the behavior of the system.
