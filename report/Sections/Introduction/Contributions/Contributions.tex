The contributions of this work are summarized as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Development of a tunable distributed cooperative control algorithm for multiagent systems in payload transportation within a microgravity environment. The tunability includes the ability to adjust the model’s dynamic mode, controller rate, cost function modifications, and, when necessary, trajectory replanning.
    \item Simulation testing of the cooperative algorithm and characterization of the system’s performance across multiple architectures.
    \item Real-world testing of the cooperative algorithm using an air-bearing table.
    \item A scientific paper that details the cooperative control algorithm as well as the relation with the trajectory planning and the results obtained with this work when compared to a baseline.
    \item Creation of a GitHub Repository that houses all code and documentation necessary for testing and utilizing the materials developed throughout this work. \footnote{The organization can be accessed at https://github.com/Planning-and-Control-in-Space-Cobot.} \footnote{Please note that this work will be completed by October 31, 2025, meaning any early access to the link will not provide full content.
