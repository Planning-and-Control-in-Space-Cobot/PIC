The contributions of this work are summarized as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item A comprehensive study and summary of various methods for optimal trajectory generation.
    \item An analysis of different approaches for trajectory tracking in cooperative robotic systems, focusing on payload transportation while also considering the need for collision avoidance with unknown obstacles.
    \item Development of a tunable cooperative control algorithm for multi-agent systems in payload transportation within a microgravity environment. The tunability includes the ability to adjust the model’s dynamic mode, controller rate, cost function modifications, and, when necessary, trajectory replanning.
    \item Simulation testing of the cooperative algorithm and characterization of the system’s performance across multiple architectures.
    \item Real-world testing of the cooperative algorithm using an air-bearing table.
    \item Creation of a GitHub organization that houses all code and documentation necessary for testing and utilizing the materials developed throughout this work. \footnote{The organization can be accessed at https://github.com/Planning-and-Control-in-Space-Cobot.} \footnote{Please note that this work will be completed by October 31, 2025, meaning any early access to the link will not provide full content. Only open-source technologies used are currently available.}
