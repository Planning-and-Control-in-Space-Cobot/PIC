As previously mentioned, solving minimization problems requires the use of numerical solvers after the problem formulation phase. CasADi \cite{Andersson2019} is an open-source tool widely used for nonlinear optimization and algorithmic differentiation. In this work, CasADi is utilized due to its capability to efficiently and intuitively formulate nonlinear optimization problems, a subset of nonlinear programming problems (NLPs), using symbolic computation.

CasADi plays a central role in the implementation of the NMPC controller and the cooperative control algorithm discussed in subsequent sections. Its symbolic programming framework provides a fast and user-friendly interface for defining and solving complex optimization problems, making it an invaluable tool for this research.
